Dust Yard ${project.version}

There is no secret in the fact that when crushed stone is used, the volume of
concrete produced generally is less than when gravel is employed as the coarse
aggregate in concrete of identical proportions. The reason for this fact is that
gravel generally has a smaller percentage of voids than crushed stone because it
is rounded in shape and rounded particles of a given gradation have a smaller
percentage of voids than angular particles of the same gradation. If the
gradations differ to any appreciable extent, it may be that, in a few cases,
the crushed stone will have a smaller percentage of voids than the gravel but
this is not the rule. Since gravel concrete of given proportions occupies a
greater volume than stone concrete of the same proportions, it follows that a
somewhat lesser amount of cement is used per cubic yard in gravel concrete
than in stone concrete. Conversely, stone concrete, as a general rule,
requires more cement per cubic yard than gravel concrete when like volumetric
proportions are used for both materials.
